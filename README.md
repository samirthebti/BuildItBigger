# Build It Bigger
Build It Bigger is the sixth project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

Used Gradle to build a joke-telling app that has both a free and paid version. This included factoring functionality into libraries as well as using build flavors to modularize the construction of each variant of the app. I also configured a Google Cloud Endpoints development server to supply the jokes.
